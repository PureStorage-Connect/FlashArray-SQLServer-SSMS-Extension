# Pure Storage® FlashArray Management Extension for SQL Server Management Studio

The Pure Storage® FlashArray Management Extension for Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (aka FA SSMS Extension) is a database backup and restore extension for Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The extension supports creating Application Consistent snapshots using the Pure Storage Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) Hardware Provider. The extension can be used from the SSMS GUI or automated using the Pure Storage Backup SDK Windows PowerShell module. Database Administrators (DBAs) can manage backup and restore operations on local and remote databases from a centralized SSMS deployment.
